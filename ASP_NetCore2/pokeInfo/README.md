For this assignment we will be using the PokeApi, which is a quite simple external API that does not require a key to access. A link to the Api website can be found below:

PokeApi

Create a web page that grabs an ID number from the URL and displays the following information about the corresponding Pokemon: Your page should show the Pokemon's name, types, height and weight.

Name
Primary Type
Height
Weight
Remember, API response objects come in many configurations. Be prepared to dig deeper into the json to find the information you want. Hint: the vscode debugger is your friend here!
