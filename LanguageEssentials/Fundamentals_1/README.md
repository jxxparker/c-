#Fundamentals


Assignment was asked to do the following.

Fundamentals I
It's important that you get familiar with using C# variables as well as if/else statements and loops. After all, these are the essential components you'll use to build majority of the features of your apps. The basic assignments are to help you master some of these basic concepts. 

Please create a new .NET project and finish these exercises before uploading.




 Create a Loop that prints all values from 1-255
 Create a new loop that prints all values from 1-100 that are divisible by 3 or 5, but not both
 Modify the previous loop to print "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5
 (Optional) If you used modulus in the last step, try doing the same without using it. Vice-versa for those who didn't!
 (Optional) Generate 10 random values and output the respective word, in relation to step three, for the generated values


Use a multidimensional array to store all values

 
List of Flavors
Create a list of Ice Cream flavors that holds at least 5 different flavors (feel free to add more than 5!)
Output the length of this list after building it
Output the third flavor in the list, then remove this value.
Output the new length of the list (Note it should just be one less~)

User Info Dictionary
Create a Dictionary that will store both string keys as well as string values
For each name in the array of names you made previously, add it as a new key in this dictionary with value null
For each name key, select a random flavor from the flavor list above and store it as the value
Loop through the Dictionary and print out each user's name and their associated ice cream flavor.
