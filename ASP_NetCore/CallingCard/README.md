Create a simple app that reads in parameters from a single GET route and renders the values with a JSON response. Your route should accept four parameters:

First Name
Last Name
Age
Favorite Color
A user using your app would expect to enter a route such as http://localhost/Tim/Toolmam/42/Brown to which you should display the appropriate information as a JSON response.
